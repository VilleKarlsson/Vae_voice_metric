# Vae_voice_metric
With variational autoencoders one can obtain a low dimensional representation of the high dimensional sound data. The latent space is a metric space, so in this project we try to find out whether the natural distance metric induced by the latent space works as a reliable way to indentify a speaker. The dataset used in the project is the google speech commands dataset, of which we initially plan to use the only numbers utterances.
